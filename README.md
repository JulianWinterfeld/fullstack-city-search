# Interview for the Position as Fullstack JavaScript Developer

This is my try at the coding challenge from it-excelsus GmbH from this repository:

https://github.com/it-excelsus/interview-junior-fullstack-javascript/tree/main


## How does it work?

1. **Frontend:** The frontend is stared with "npm run dev"

2. **Backend:** The backend is started with "npx tsx index.ts"

3. **Database:** The database can be ignored, since i tried doing it here but had complications, so i moved the database to the backend (i used SQLite and Prisma for the database)

## Thank you for the opportunity 

The challenge was really fun, although i didnt work with some of the Tools yet.
Im really looking forward to get your feedback.

Best regards,
Julian Winterfeld
